# Perceptron-Multiclass-Predictions

To predict the owl type in Ireland based on body length, body width, wing length and wing width
This is self designed R code to predict the Owl Type based on several features. However, this code can be used on any data where there are
3 calsses to predict from. Please see ML_perceptron.pdf for complete design and implementation. Note: code is not optimized yet. Thanks

Note: The data should be linearly seperable.
